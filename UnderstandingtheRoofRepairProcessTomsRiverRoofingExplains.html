              <h3>When Should You Consider Roof Replacement? </h3>
            </li>
            <p>Sometimes, <a href="https://www.google.com/maps?cid=10363635679860394019">roof repairs</a> aren't enough to address the issues with your roof, and a full replacement may be necessary. Here are some signs that it might be time to replace your roof:
            </p>
            <li>
              <h3>Age of the Roof: </h3>
            </li>
            <p>Most <a href="http://www.greenappleroofing.com/">roofs</a> last around 20-25 years. If your roof is nearing the end of its lifespan, it might be time to consider a replacement.</p>
            <li>
              <h3>Frequent Repairs: </h3>
            </li>
            <p>If you're calling for <a href="https://www.google.com/maps?cid=10363635679860394019">roof repairs</a> frequently, it might be more cost-effective to invest in a new roof rather than continuing to patch up the old one.

            </p>
            <li>
              <h3>Energy Efficiency Issues: </h3>
            </li>

Common signs that indicate the need for attention include:

Missing or Damaged Shingles: If shingles are missing, cracked, or curled, it can compromise the roof's integrity.
Frequent Leaks: Recurring leaks, especially after repairs, may suggest underlying issues that repairs alone cannot resolve.
Granule Loss: Finding granules in gutters indicates shingles are deteriorating.
